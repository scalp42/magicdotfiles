# Sexy Dotfiles


The idea is to have a simple way to encrypt/decrypt your .dotfiles (for those with AWS creds, etc) :

- toencrypt -> contains the dotfiles you want to encrypt (using massencrypt.sh)

- toencrypt/pass -> passphrase used to encrypt/decrypt your files (using massencrypt.sh)

- encrypted -> your dotfiles encrypted, can be safely checked in

- decrypted -> used as a temporary place to then symlink those in your home folder

- install.sh -> do the magic

- massencrypt.sh -> helper to mass encrypt your files directly


Make sure to look at .gitignore for easier understandingâ€¦\


Don't bother forking that stuff, it's not **sexy** yet.
